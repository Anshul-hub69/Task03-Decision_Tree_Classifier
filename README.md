# Decision Tree Classifier – Bank Marketing Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal is to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their **demographic** and **behavioral** data.

Dataset used: **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains marketing campaign data from a Portuguese banking institution.  
You can find it here: [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)  

**Key Features:**

- Contact type, campaign duration
- Economic indicators

**Target Variable (`y`):**
- `yes` – Customer subscribed to the term deposit
- `no` – Customer did not subscribe

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading** – Read dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Exploration** – Checked dataset shape, data types, and missing values.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.
4. **Model Building** – Created and trained a Decision Tree Classifier.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Measured accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
